	<h1>Analysis of Counter-examples vs Invariants</h1>
	<p>In this page we perform a refined analysis that distinguishes two kinds of properties:
		<ul>
			<li>INV : A property that requires a proof, that is universal and bears over all states or paths.</li>
			<li>CEX : A property you can disprove (or prove) by exhibiting a counter-example (or witness)</li>
			<li>UNK : Properties for which no verdict is available, because no tool could treat it, so that we don't know whether it is INV or CEX.</li>
		</ul>		
	</p>
	<p>
		We introduce this decomposition of properties for Global Properties :
		<ul>
			<li>ReachabilityDeadlock : if TRUE, there is a deadlock, it is CEX. Otherwise it is considered INV.</li>
			<li>StableMarking : if TRUE, there is a place whose marking will never vary, it is CEX. Otherwise it is considered INV.</li>
			<li>OneSafe : if FALSE, there is a place whose marking can exceed 1, it is CEX. Otherwise it is considered INV.</li>
			<li>QuasiLiveness : if FALSE, there is a transition that can never be fired, it is CEX.  Otherwise it is considered INV.</li>
			<li>Liveness : if FALSE, there is a transition that is not live, it is CEX. Otherwise it is considered INV.</li>
		</ul>
		We introduce also introduce it for Reachability and LTL:
		<ul>
			<li>Reachability AG : when the formula is of the form AG(p), and it is FALSE it is CEX. Otherwise it is considered INV.</li>
			<li>Reachability EF : when the formula is of the form EF(p), and it is TRUE it is CEX (a witness suffices). Otherwise it is considered INV.</li>
			<li>LTL : when the formula is FALSE it is CEX (and we can produce a counter-example). Otherwise it is considered INV since a TRUE LTL property naturally covers all paths.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>We first study the decomposition of formulas in the MCC benchmark according to this criterion.</p>
